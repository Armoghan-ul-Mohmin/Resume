## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Armoghan-ul-MohminWebsite-Starter.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
   cd Website-Starter
```
3. Install project dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
## Folder Structure
The project has the following folder structure:

*`` public/``: This is the output folder where the compiled and optimized files are generated. This is the folder you would deploy to a web server.
* ``src/``: This is the source folder where you'll work on your project.
* ``scss/``: Write your styles in Sass. This is where you'll find the SCSS files.
*`` assets/``: This folder contains your JavaScript files and images.
    * ``js/``: Add your JavaScript files here.
    * ``images/``: Place your images here.
* ``**/*.html``: Create your HTML files here.
## Usage
### Development
To start a development server with auto-refresh, run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will compile Sass, watch for changes in your HTML, JavaScript, and image files, and open a live preview in your browser. Access the development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Build
To create a production-ready build of your project, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will compile and optimize your code, including minifying CSS and JavaScript, removing unused CSS rules, and copying necessary files to the public folder.

## Customization
You can customize the project by editing the following directories and files:

* ``src/scss/``: Write your styles in Sass.
* ``src/assets/js/``: Add your JavaScript files.
* ``src/assets/images/``: Place your images here.
* ``src/**/*.html``: Create your HTML files.

## Additional Details
* **Browser Compatibility**: The included CSS is compatible with modern browsers and Internet Explorer 11.
* **Responsive Design**: The template uses a responsive design approach, ensuring your site looks great on various screen sizes.
* **Performance**: The build process optimizes your assets for performance, including image compression and minification of CSS and JavaScript.
* **Version Control**: We recommend using a version control system like Git to track changes in your project.
